# Course Project

This folder contains:
* cookbook.md - descripes the variables and transformations done and created in the run_analysis.R
* run_analysis.R - transforms a data set and creates a tidy data set as a result

Run the script *run_analysis.R* to transform a given data set of test and training data of the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone to a tidy data set.

The script assumes that the datasets are in your working directory in the folder data.

You may find the data here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
